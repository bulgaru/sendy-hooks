# Sendy Hooks
Sendy is a powerful email marketing platform. Yet often we need automation to have an efficient workflow.

Sendy hooks addresses the need to automate the contact collection from Wordpress to Sendy.

It relies on a set of hooks. Currently it has 3 hooks:
1) New Sendy contact on user registration
2) New Sendy contact on user purchase (WooCommerce)
3) New Sendy contact on user form submission (Contact Form 7)

The code is modular and allows adding new hooks and integrating new plugin support.

Moreover, all the settings are natively available in the Wordpress Admin interface.

# Installation

Simply upload the files into your Wordpress plugin directory.
